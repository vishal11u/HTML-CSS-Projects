        <p> Coding is done using programming languages, which are sets of rules and syntax that computers can understand. There are numerous programming languages available, each with its own strengths and purposes. Some popular languages include Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Ruby.
            Coding involves designing algorithms, which are step-by-step instructions for solving a specific problem. It requires logical thinking and breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Efficient algorithms can improve the performance and speed of programs.
            Coding is not limited to professional programmers or software engineers. It has become a valuable skill for people in diverse fields, including scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and students. Learning to code can empower you to automate tasks, build tools, and bring your ideas to life in the digital realm.
            Remember, coding is a skill that requires practice and perseverance. Starting with the basics and gradually building your knowledge and experience will help you become a proficient coder.

        <h2>Section 2:-</h2>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a combination of programming, designing, and managing the various aspects of a website. Web development encompasses both the front-end and back-end development of a website.

            Front-end development focuses on the user interface and user experience of a website. It involves writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create the visual elements and interactive features that users interact with in their web browsers. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring the content of web pages, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and functionality.
            
            Back-end development deals with the server-side of web applications. It involves working with databases, servers, and the logic that powers the website. Common back-end technologies include server-side programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js, and database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. Back-end development handles tasks such as processing user input, managing databases, and generating dynamic content.
            Overall, web development is a multidisciplinary field that requires a combination of technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities to create functional and visually appealing websites and web applications.
